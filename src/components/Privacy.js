              <h4>1. Introduction:</h4> <br />
              Welcome to the IT Team website or mobile application (“Site”).
              Golpe LLC (“IT Team”, “we”, “us”, and/or “our”) operates this
              Site, and its mobile application, to provide our users (“you” and
              “your”) with information about IT Team and its platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              IT Team is used by professional freelancers (“Freelancers”) who
              wish to offer their development, engineering and other services
              (“Services”) and clients who need the Services (“Clients”).
              Freelancers that have passed our screening process and are
              admitted to our network of professional Freelancers (“Network”)
              are referred to as “Talent”. For purposes of this policy the term
              “Freelancers” is broader in scope and includes both Talent and
              Freelancers who are not Talent. The Personal Data we receive from
              Freelancers and Clients and how we handle it differs, so we
              explain our data practices for Freelancers and Clients in two
              distinct sections below. Navigate to the section that applies to
              you: Freelancers; Clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h4>2. Scope:</h4> <br />
              This Privacy Policy sets out how IT Team collects, retains, and
              uses information, including personal data (“Personal Data”) about
              Freelancers, Clients, and other Site visitors and individuals,
              which include our vendors, partners, blog readers, and job
              applicants. The Privacy Policy also applies to users of IT Team
              affiliated sites, and data that IT Team collects in-person, for
              instance, at business conferences and trade shows.
            </p>
            <p>

              you, your consent to the collection of such additional data will

              by Clients seeking Freelancers. Our mobile application is also
              accessible by members of our Talent network. The mobile
              application may collect location information in an effort to
              tailor the user experience.

            <p>
              IT Team uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is
              consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data
              for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection
              with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you
              contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to
              answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide
              Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will

              Services, maintain your account, contact you regarding your use of

              services. For individuals in the EU, such use is necessary to
              respond to or implement your request and for the performance of
              the contract between you and us.
            </p>
            <p>B. For Marketing Purposes</p>
            <p>
              We may use your contact details to tell you about services we
              believe will be of interest to you, upcoming events or other
              promotions. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you
              will contain instructions permitting you to “opt out” of receiving
              future marketing communications. Note, however, that as a user of
              our services you cannot opt out of some administrative
              communications that are reasonably necessary to the services, such
              as billing or service notifications. In addition, if at any time
              you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you
              wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please
              contact us as indicated below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where required by applicable law (for example, if you are an
              individual in the EU), we will only send you marketing information
              by email if you consent to us doing so at the time you provide us
              with your Personal Data. When you provide us with your consent to
              be contacted for marketing purposes, you have the right to
              withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions to
              “opt-out” of receiving marketing communication in each marketing
              email we send you or by contacting us as indicated below.

              effectiveness of our promotional campaigns) and to inform our
              marketing strategy and personalize our communications with you
              (including providing information on our features and other
              marketing and service-related announcements relevant to the
              content and features you engage with). To supplement the

              If IT Team intends to use any Personal Data in any manner that is
              not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of
              such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal
              Data is collected and pursuant to the applicable law.

              To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal
              Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the
              Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
              disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use
              your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes
              through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In
              some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it
              can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no
              longer Personal Data.

              under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not
              submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents
              and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and

              permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the
              age of 13 has provided Personal Data to IT Team through this Site,
              please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information
              from our databases.

              <h4>15. Security</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
              IT Team takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the
              Personal Data provided via the Site or the services from loss,
              misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
              destruction. However, no Internet, email or other electronic
              transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should
              take special care in deciding what information you send to us in
              this way.
